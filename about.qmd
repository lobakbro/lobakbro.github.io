Hi! My name is Kevin Ong and this is my personal blog. I'm also known as lobakbro through the interwebs! 

I am a machine learning engineer that lives in 🌉 San Francisco, California. My professional interests are in deep learning!

My other interests include being an active member of the 🏳️‍🌈 and local asian community, classical music ♫♬ (Rachmaninoff, Sibelius, and Mahler), plants 🌱, a perfect 🍜 bowl of beef noodle soup (bun bo & lanzhou la mian) 

This blog is built with <3 with Quarto.
